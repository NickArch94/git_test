        <h3>Chorus 1</h3>
        <p><em>Promise me</em> we'll never grow up,
        I don't wanna let go,
        I wanna stay young.</p>

        <p>And even when the wrinkles show up,
        We'll be laughing, and 
        We can play forever, <strong>don't make me face the truth...</strong></p>

        <h3>Chorus 2:</h3>
        <p><em>Promise me</em> we'll never grow up,
        I don't wanna fall out,
        I wanna make love</p>

        <p>And even when we can't, so what?
        We're together, and
        Happy ever after, <strong>don't make me face the truth</strong></p>

        <p>That I'm dying <em>soon</em>
        That we're dying...</p>
